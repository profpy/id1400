# Python Variables

In this lab you will learn about variables in Python.

## Variables

- A variable is data that can change.
- The type of a variable is determined by Python.
- A variable's value can change when a program is executed.

## Assign a value to a variable

A variable is created the first time it is assigned a value.  

To assign a variable a value, use the =

```
university = "Kean"
```
![Variables1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/profpy/id1400/master/lecture3/variables1.gif)

Notice, Kean has quotations around it.  This is because it's a string.  More on that later!
